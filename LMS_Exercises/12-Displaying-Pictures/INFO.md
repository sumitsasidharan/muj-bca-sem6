## Exercise 12: Displaying Pictures

#### 1. Objective
Create an application that uses a content provider to access and display data. This could
be integrated into the to-do list app or another application, introducing the concept of
content providers and data sharing between apps.

### 2. Steps to Complete the Experiment
1. Select or Create Image Resources:

Choose or create a set of images that you want to display in your application. These can be pictures related to your app's theme or any other images you wish to
showcase. Save these images in your project's res/drawable folder.

2. Design the UI Layout: Decide how you want to display the images in your application. Options include using a GridView for a grid layout, an ImageSwitcher for one image at a time with
swiping, or a Gallery (deprecated, consider using a RecyclerView with a horizontal layout manager instead) for a horizontal list.
For this example, let's use a GridView. Define the GridView in your activity's layout XML file (activity_main.xml).

3. Create a Custom Adapter (if necessary): For a simple display, you might use an ArrayAdapter with built-in layouts. For more customization, such as with a GridView, create a custom adapter by
extending BaseAdapter. Implement required methods in the adapter, such as getCount(), getItem(), getItemId(), and getView(). In getView(), inflate your custom layout for individual
grid items and set the image for each item. 

4. Implement Image Selection (optional): To add functionality for when a user selects an image, set an onItemClickListener on your GridView. In the listener, you could display the image in a larger view, start a new activity with the image details, or any other action you prefer.

Step 1: Define Grid Item Layout
First, create an XML layout file for individual grid items. Let's call this grid_item.xml. This layout will contain an ImageView that fills the grid cell.
